A simple life simulation system lightly based on darvinian theory.
Simulation map consists of two types of fields, with differing chances of food appearing. There are also animals, which move randomly based on genome (which represents likelyhoods of movement in a given direction). Without food, animals lose energy and eventualy die. However, if they have enough energy and two of them meet on the same space, a new animal will appear. Its genom will be a combinatation of genes from it's parents.

Start up settings are specified in the included TODO.JSON file. Otherwise provides a GUI system (implemented in java swing), which encompasses settings like simulation time step, pausing/running and statistics tracking.
Created for Object-Oriented Programming course (winter semester 2019/2020).
